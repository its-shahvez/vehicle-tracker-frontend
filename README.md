# üöó Vehicle Tracker UI (Frontend)

This is the frontend user interface for the Vehicle Tracker application, built with React, Vite, and React-Leaflet. It visualizes a vehicle's journey on an interactive map by fetching route data from a [corresponding backend API](https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-tracker-backend).
